  <h1>Nhi's Top 5 Favorite Movies</h1>
  <body>Something that most people may not know about me is that I <em> LOVE </em> movies. Movies and films have shaped me greatly into the person I am today. There is so much knowledge and wisdom to gain from each and every film. From horror to musicals I have watched them all and this website will compile my favorite films from my 15 years of life. <em> BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD </em> </body>

  <h2>Inglorious Bastards: The Tension Builder</h2>
  <body>Not every day is there a villain created as evil and horrifying as Landa. Of course, there had to be at least 1 Tarantino film on this list. Many were in mind, with a close runner up being Reservoir Dogs (which I highly recommend). The one thing that made this film the one to watch for me was Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter. This movie sets place in a historical fiction version of WW2 Nazis occupied France. The first few minutes of the film would already scare the
