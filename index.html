 <h1>Nhi's Top 5 Favorite Movies</h1>

 <p>Something that most people may not know about me is that I <em> LOVE </em> movies. Movies and films have shaped me greatly into the person I am today. There is so much knowledge and wisdom to gain from each and every film. From horror to musicals I have watched them all and this website will compile my favorite films from my 15 years of life. <em> BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD </em> </p>

 <h2>Why is Film Important?</h2>
 <p>Film is more than just a plot or acting. Watching a film is a visual, audio, and sometimes emotional experience. For a few hours, a great film can get you emotionally invested to strangers and unfamiliar places. This emotional connection created between the viewer and a film can impact people in greater ways than first seen. We cry, laugh, and sympathise with these humans and experience a whole different world. One film can take you to a galaxy far far away fighting the evil forces and the next can take you to the harrowing jungles in Vietnam. This does not mean that every film will be good, but great films will always touch a person in a way no other form of art can.</p>

 <h3><a name="West Side Story: A Modern Day Romeo and Juliet"> West Side Story: A Modern Day Romeo and Juliet</a></h3>
 <p>Everyone has heard the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet. In this musical rendition taking place 1961 NYC, we see the conflict and tension of race and gangs take the lives of the hopeful youth. We are smitten with the main characters Maria and Tony as they fall in love at first sight. It is a tale that has been told time and time again with young lovers from rival gangs. The film takes the audience on a visual and musical journey that is shot with elegance and beauty that make us feel for both sides of the story. The songs and dance routines throughout this musical leaves the audience wanting more making a great use of the NYC terrain and landscape from the early 60s. This movie is a great film that allows the audience to be engulfed in a beautiful period in time with a tale we all know too well. If you have the patience for random dance breaks this is the perfect film for you.</p>

 <h3><a name="Inglorious Bastards: The Tension Builder"> Inglorious Basterds: The Tension Builder</a></h3>
 <p>Not every day is there a villain created as evil and horrifying as Landa. Of course, there had to be at least 1 Tarantino film on this list. Many were in mind, with a close runner up being Reservoir Dogs (which I highly recommend). The one thing that made this film the one to watch for me was Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter. This movie sets place in a historical fiction version of WW2 Nazis occupied France. The first scene of the movie shows how truly great this villain is. The movie introduces us to this villain with us only knowing that he is a nazis officer. With little to no detail of this man, Tarentino already gets us nervous. We learn that Landa is searching for Jews hiding in the farmer’s house and is slowly taking control of the situation with his military power and careful dialogue. The audience learns that that there are in fact Jews hiding right under his feet in the floorboard causing the tension to uproar. The scene takes a cruel turn of events when we see the farmer break in the overwhelming tension. The scene ends with people dead and the audience wondering the true extent of this man’s power. This movie is riddled with intense scenes that leave the audience to constantly question if he knows. The memorable characters and classic Tarentino violence makes this movie one to watch.</p>

 <h3><a name="Taxi Driver: The Effects of Loneliness"> Taxi Driver: The Effects of Loneliness</a></h3>
<p>Everyone has felt the effects of loneliness. I remember vividly feeling so during my back surgery in my freshman year of highschool and it affecting my whole mentality in such a painful and difficult manner. This movie shows its effect on a Vietnam vet in a span of 1 hour and 54 minutes. This particular film is an in depth character study, which is not meant for everyone since people can find these boring. The film is shot in the backdrop of the late 70s in NYC with the main character, Travis, being a late night taxi driver suffering from insomnia and an intense case of loneliness. The movie shows the slow crumble of Travis's mental health blurring the lines of sanity and insanity. Serious topics such as child prostitution, racism, and mental illness are brought up in a way that isn't glamorized, but caring of the characters involved. This film will make watchers reevaluate themselves and rethink the world and people around us. Although there is much debate on the meaning and ending of the film, it will be different for everyone who gives it a shot.</p>

<h3><a name="Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Hardships of Losing Those You Love"> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Hardships of Losing Those You Love</a></h3>
  <p>This movie hits everyone with the experience of emotionally losing those that you love even if they are still there in reality. This movie shows a universe similar to ours, with the availability to erase people that you choose out of your memory. This movie is a romantic break up film, but it is so much more than that. The film delves into the complications of any friendship between people and shows the painful and emotional effects or a falling out. These characters are in the midst of this situation which leads to them trying to erase each other out of their minds. The movie explores the depths of the human mind shot in a dizzy and beautiful way that makes us look at ourselves and the people around us in a different light. </p>

  <h3><a name="Dead Poets Society: Being a Teenager"> Dead Poets Society: Being a Teenager</a></h3>
  <p>Dead Poets Society is more than a film to me. I recommend this movie to anyone at all. This film explores the pressures of societal expectations of what you should do with yourself and your life, and specifically targeting teenage kids like me. The film builds up all the characters to the point in which I empathize and felt so strongly for these characters to succeed. These characters are teenagers trying to navigate and find their place to belong in life, but are constantly met with difficulty from parents, teachers, and expectations. The teacher who guides them, played by the talented Robin Williams, gives them the options and possibilities to be the best that they can be when the world around them want them to be something they are not. This constant fear of expectations and belonging somewhere is something I face a lot and this movie does such a great job of explaining the depths of it through relatable and memorable characters.</p>
