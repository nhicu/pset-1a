 <h3><a name="Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Hardships of Losing Those You Love"> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Hardships of Losing Those You Love</a></h3>
   <p class="section">This movie hits everyone with the experience of emotionally losing those that you love even if they are still there in reality. This movie shows a universe similar to ours, with the availability to erase people that you choose out of your memory. This movie is a romantic break up film, but it is so much more than that. The film delves into the complications of any friendship between people and shows the painful and emotional effects or a falling out. These characters are in the midst of this situation which leads to them trying to erase each other out of their minds. The movie explores the depths of the human mind shot in a dizzy and beautiful way that makes us look at ourselves and the people around us in a different light. </p>
